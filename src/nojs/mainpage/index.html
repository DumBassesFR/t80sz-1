    <h2 style="color: #FFEA33;">Welcome to The 80s Zone!</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">
    Born from the ashes of the official <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>I am Jemboy</b></span> Discord server, <br><span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The 80s Zone</b></span>
    has been a social hangout for hundreds of people <br>since its public launch on <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>July 4th, 2018.</b></span>
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
So where did the community originate from? It all started on <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>September 20th, 2017</b></span><br>
when mashup youtuber <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>I am Jemboy</b></span> had the idea of creating a public hangout <br>for fans and creators alike.
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
In his mind, it would be a relaxed environment where everyone could be friendly <br>and creative whilst running the server with a hands off approach. <br>Unfortunately,
on <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>September 29th, 2017</b></span>, reality hit.
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
<span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The Bear Zone</b></span> as it was called was a place centered around the idea of chaos<br>and teenage humor, making it a place rife
for drama. Though there were issues that persisted <br>throughout its <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>9 months</b></span>, a tightknit community was born out of the
hellish environment.
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
With a high staff turnover rate and neglect from an owner<br> that had seemingly abandoned the place, it was up to the community <br>to fend for itself and become
self sustainable.

</p>
<p style="color: white;">
So on <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>July 4th, 2018</b></span>, <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The Bear Zone</b></span> was shut down via a battle royale <br>and retooled to become an archive while <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The 80s Zone</b></span> became a fresh start for the community,<br> owned by <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>D Vana</b></span> until <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>February 21st, 2019</b></span>.
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
<span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>Skelly</b></span> from that point on became owner and essentially demoted himself to the level<br> of a mod, freeing the server from any real ownership.
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
It has since been several years and the community goes on,<br> acting in a way that's starkly different from the days of <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>Fall 2017</b></span>.
</p>
<h2 style="color: white;">Despite its name, <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The 80s Zone</b></span><br> has very little to actually do
  with <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>the 1980's</b></span>!</h2>
<p style="color: white;">
<span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The 80s Zone</b></span> <i>does</i> however, represent a
group of people dedicated to creativity, spending time with one <br>another, and spreading the word of the community.
</p>
<p style="color: white;">
For reference, in <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>2020</b></span>, <span style="color:#FFEA33"><b>The 80s Zone</b></span> pulled a total
of <span style="color: #FFEA33"><b>1.57 million</b></span> messages in conversation, images, <br>and other pieces of media shared! There's a lot to enjoy with the server
whether it's the anime community in <code style="color:#FFEA33"><b>#toonami</b></code>,<br> the technology community
in <code style="color:#FFEA33"><b>#informix</b></code>, or the large art community found throughout the <code style="color:#FFEA33"><b>Westnet</b></code> category.
